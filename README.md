# ihwbar

A GDI C++ windows "bar" as my first C++ project.  

## Keybinds


- `ESC`: Close IHWBar (while focused)
- `F1`: Open Config Editor (while focused)
- `Win+CTRL+H`: Hide/Show IHWBar
- `Win+CTRL+R`: Reload IHWBar
- `Win+CTRL+ESC`: Exit IHWBar globally

## Features

- .ini configuration (extension .ihw)
- Widgets for simple dev experience
- Simple configuration easy to undestand??!
- Config editor (bare bones)

## How to use

To build IHWBar, you must first have the Native Tools command prompt for visual studio.  
Once you open that, you can `cd` into the ihwbar directory.

Example: `cd C:\Users\Me\Downloads\ihwbar-main`

Then, you can run `build.bat` to build IHWBar.

Example: `build` (If this doesnt work for you, `build.bat`)

IHWBar will automatically compile and start.

## You made it down here!

Congratulations, i will now tell you what IHW stands for.
