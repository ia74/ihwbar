# ihwbar

A GDI C++ windows "bar" as my first C++ project.  

## Keybinds

You must be focused on the bar! You'll know when the ActiveWindow widget (provided you have set one up by changing the type from Text to ActiveWindow) says "Ready for keybind input"

- `ESC`: Close IHWBar
- `F1`: Open Config Editor

## Features

- .ini configuration (extension .ihw)
- Widgets for simple dev experience
- Simple configuration easy to undestand??!
- Config editor (bare bones)

## How to use

To build IHWBar, you must first have the Native Tools command prompt for visual studio.  
Once you open that, you can `cd` into the ihwbar directory.

Example: `cd C:\Users\Me\Downloads\ihwbar-main`

Then, you can run `build.bat` to build IHWBar.

Example: `build` (If this doesnt work for you, `build.bat`)

IHWBar will automatically compile and start.

## You made it down here!

Congratulations, i will now tell you what IHW stands for.
